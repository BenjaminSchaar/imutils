Description: # Installation
        To install this as package you should check
        https://bitbucket.vbc.ac.at/projects/ZL/repos/protocols/browse/Installing_personal_Python_packages.md
        
        Shortly:
        1. Open Terminal and activate your environment (example your_env)
        	```
        	conda activate your_env
        	```
        2. Install it with a pip command (pointing to the directory where you cloned it)
        	```
        	pip install /code/imutils/
        	```
        	or better:
        	cd to the directory where you cloned the directory
        	```
        	cd ../code/imutils/
        	```
        	And then pip install the local directory
        	```
        	pip install .
        	```
        	
        	This would be wrong:
        	```
        	pip install imutils
        	```
        	Because it will install another imutils package that someone has uploaded to pip.
